# Mind Oasis Backend 

This is the backend for the **Mind Oasis** project, built with Spring Boot and Java 17.
**Mind Oasis** is an art-inspired mindfulness and journaling web application designed to leverage visual metaphors as catalysts for self-reflection. When stress makes it difficult to articulate complex feelings into words, Mind Oasis provides a "visual outlet" for the internal landscape.

## Concept & Vision
- **Image-to-Emotion Connection:** Addresses the issue of *inarticulacy* by allowing users to select visual metaphors that mirror their emotional state.
- **Artistic Resonance:** Integrates with **The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)** Open Access collection to provide users with resonant artistic experiences.
- **Guided Reflection:** Facilitates spiritual healing through a "Select Metaphor -> Guided Journaling -> Art Dialogue" workflow.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (JavaScript)
- **Backend:** Java + Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** AWS (App Runner & RDS)
